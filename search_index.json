R Workshops Session Date Topic Recordings 1.1 06/02/2021 Exploratory Data Analysis Zoom link 1.2 06/02/3021 Data Wrangling Zoom link Instructions We will be using RStudio Cloud for these workshops. Before the workshops, please visit Rstudio Cloud and create a free account. Free accounts give limited usage, but are more than enough for these workshops. Why RStudio Cloud? We want to maximize time during our workshops for learning, and not on tech support. Using a standard way of interacting with the course material makes this easier, and avoids the hassles of multiple installation types, versions of R, etc. You may wish to set up R and RStudio on your local machine but that will not be required here. 0.0.1 RStudio Cloud Instructions for how to navigate to our RStudio Cloud project and set up the project so you can work on the exercises in your own web browser can be found here. RStudio Cloud set up guide &amp; instructions Code of Conduct These workshops follow the Fay Lab code of conduct: Data Science Course in a Box These materials draw heavily from the Data Science in a Box project, which contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) an introductory data science course using R, all of which are freely-available and open-source. Incredibly grateful to Mine Çetinkaya &amp; the rstudio education team for this amazing resoure! See datasciencebox.org for everything you need to know about the project.

There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! Right now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid &amp; @allisonhorst. They teach a lot of the workflow and tools around using R right from the get go, which we think is more helpful than knowing how to do all the things. The (excellent) materials are thoughtfully put together, link to a ton of other great resources, and just like the online #rstats community in general, are super supportive of new learners. If you want a book to work from/through, R for Data Science is highly recommended. (book is free online) A plug for the online R community. Follow the hashtag #rstats, &amp; also check out accounts @RLadiesGlobal &amp; @R4dsCommunity. The weekly #TidyTuesday social coding project is also a great way to practice your growing R skills.
