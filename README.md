## Fishery Dependent Data WoRkshops

These resources were created for learning and developing shared understanding around fishery dependent data in the Northeast US, and were used for a series of workshops held in 2021 as part of a UMassD-SMAST / NOAA / CINAR project on developing standardized CPUE for groundfish (PI Prof Steve Cadrin).  

## R Workshops

Session | Date | Topic
--------|------|------
1.1 | 06/02/2021 | Exploratory Data Analysis
1.2 | 06/02/3021 | Data Wrangling


## Instructions

We will be using RStudio Cloud for these workshops.  
Before the workshop, please visit [Rstudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and create a free account.  
Free accounts give limited usage, but are more than enough for these workshops.  

Why RStudio Cloud? We want to maximize time during our workshops for learning, and not on tech support. Using a standard way of interacting with the course material makes this easier, and avoids the hassles of multiple installation types, versions of R, etc. You may wish to set up R and RStudio on your local machine but that will not be required here.  


## Data Science Course in a Box

These materials draw heavily from the Data Science in a Box project, which contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) an introductory data science course using R, all of which are freely-available and open-source.
Incredibly grateful for this amazing resoure!  
See [datasciencebox.org](https://datasciencebox.org/) for everything you need to know about the project.
